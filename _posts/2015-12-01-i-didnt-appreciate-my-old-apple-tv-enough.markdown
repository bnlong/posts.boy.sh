The new Apple TV got me pretty excited when it was announced. My Apple TV 3 wasn't being used very much, other than when I needed to [test something AirPlay related](http://www.dangercove.com/porthole).

I even bought a Chromecast to stream videos from my phone to my TV.

With the new Apple TV, I expected to play video games on it, a lot. So I purchased the SteelSeries Nimbus.

The Nimbus is now permanently connected to my iPad to play Minecraft. üòÅ
And I use the Apple TV primarily to watch the Red Bull channel while I'm eating.

If I'm not mistaken, the Red Bull channel has been on the Apple TV 3 for quite a while now..
