After watching the new [Steve Jobs movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2080374/) and a few documentaries on the guy, I felt the urge to maybe own an original Macintosh. ðŸ™ˆ

This is not as easy at is seems, though. Just [look at this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Macintosh_models) of Macintosh models!

Of course you want one that Steve worked on, which means you can't get any of the Macs that were made after spring 1985. And you definitely don't want one of the crappier, cheaper versions (like the 512Ke).

This basically leaves the Macintosh 128k and 512k. Which are obviously  harder to find and often more expensive than their more powerful successors, but hey.

Oh, by the way, the disk drive is more expensive to pick up than the computer itself these days..
