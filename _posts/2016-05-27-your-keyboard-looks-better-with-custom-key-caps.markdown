Most [mechanical keyboards](http://www.boy.sh/knows/matteo-spinelli-designs-super-pretty-keyboards) can be customized in various ways. The easiest alteration you can do is probably replacing the key caps with something that's more your taste.

I joined a [Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/r/6GDKB6) for [these Tai-Hao ABS Doubleshot key caps](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/tai-hao-abs-keysets) and replaced the old key caps on my keyboard yesterday.

Instead of yanking out the original caps immediately, I laid out the new ones first. This made the process of putting them in smooth and easy.
