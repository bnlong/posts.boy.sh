I've set my Dock to hide automatically, which means I rely on the App Switcher to (shocker, I know) switch between apps. A lot.

Annoyingly, if I switch to an app that has no visible windows, I still need to press âŒ˜ + N or whatever to make it pop up. I've just learned there's a fix for that. ðŸŽ‰

Press and hold âŒ¥ after activating the App Switcher. It will hurt your fingers, but pressing option will ensure something pops up after switching between apps.

Now I need to find a way to make this the default behaviour. Anyone?
