I'll be using [Layers](http://eiskis.net/layers/) to create the website for [Hedge](http://www.syncfactory.nl).

>Lightweight. Unobtrusive. Style-agnostic. Build your look on the web, not Twitter's ‚Äì and build it fluid.

>Layers CSS is a CSS framework aimed for practical use cases. It comes with a small footprint and zero bullshit.

Sounds good.

* Normalizations & sensible defaults
* Fluid grid + progressively enhanced columns
* Preserves native form styles by default
* No px definitions
* No colors, no borders, no rounded corners
* No dependencies
