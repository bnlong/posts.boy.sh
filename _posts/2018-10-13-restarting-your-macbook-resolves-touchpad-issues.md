Right-clicking is a pretty common, simple procedure. On a MacBook you put two fingers on the Touchpad and push down. A menu pops up, you select one of the options and that's it.

Now, imagine you need to apply double or triple the amount of force for this to happen. You really need to push hard and put some effort into it. That's how my MacBook right-clicked up until five minutes ago. I have one of the infamous 2016 models and immediately feared its end was neigh. Luckily I tried 'turning it off and on again' before writing it off then and there.

After a quick reboot the issues seems to be fixed. ðŸŽ‰
