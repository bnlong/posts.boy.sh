After seeing [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bry_62fVB1E) by AWAN, purchasing a [Keith McMillen QuNexus](http://www.keithmcmillen.com/products/qunexus/) seemed like the perfect idea.

Even more so after I noticed that you can hook it up to your iPad, as Khantipol demonstrates in [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suV1wAk0YrA).

😍

I had to send it back though, after I discovered one of the pads on the bottom of the keyboard is missing. 🙈

Hoping the new one gets here before the weekend. And isn't missing any pieces.
