[Remix OS](http://www.jide.com/en/remixos) is Jide's effort to bring a 'PC experience' to Android and it just released a version you can actually install.

I've [downloaded](http://www.jide.com/en/remixos-for-pc#downloadNow) the latest release and ran it in VMWare Fusion.

In VMWare Fusion, only the 'Guest' option seems to work and only if you press ```TAB``` in Grub and append ```vga=791``` to the boot options.
