After looking at  [Matt3o](https://twitter.com/cubiq)'s [Massdrop campaign](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/the-whitefox-keyboard) for his WhiteFox Keyboard for over an hour, I pulled the trigger and ordered one.

Can't wait to get my €200 (or €255 if customs gets hold of it) mechanical keyboard. ❤️

I went with the 'True Fox' layout and MX Blues, by the way. Hope I don't regret the latter, but I chickened out and got MX Browns too many times now.
