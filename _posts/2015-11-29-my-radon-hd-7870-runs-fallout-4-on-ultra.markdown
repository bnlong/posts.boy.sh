When Bethesda announced the minimum and recommended system requirements for Fallout 4 they looked like this:

**Minimum**

* Windows 7/8/10 (64-bit OS required)
* Intel Core i5-2300 2.8 GHz/AMD Phenom II X4 945 3.0 GHz or equivalent
* 8 GB RAM
* 30 GB free HDD space
* NVIDIA GTX 550 Ti 2GB/AMD Radeon HD 7870 2GB or equivalent

**Recommended**

* Windows 7/8/10 (64-bit OS required)
* Intel Core i7 4790 3.6 GHz/AMD FX-9590 4.7 GHz or equivalent
* 8 GB RAM
* 30 GB free HDD space
* NVIDIA GTX 780 3GB/AMD Radeon R9 290X 4GB or equivalent

My three (or four?) year old Radeon HD 7870 should barely be able to get this show on the road. I considered getting the PS4 version instead, but that would set me back €70 instead of €30.

Luckily my worries were for naught, as Fallout 4 runs perfectly fine at 1920x1200 with every graphical setting maxed out. Yay!
