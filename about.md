Most of my days are spent writing Swift and Objective-C code. Either for the company that I founded in 2011, called [Danger Cove](http://www.dangercove.com), where I make macOS apps like Denied. [Denied](https://www.getdenied.com) protects your ears from bands like Nickelback. I also work on the iOS app at [Blendle](https://www.blendle.com), often described as the Spotify of journalism.

I’m particularly interested in working with new technology and making it accessible to as many people as I can. Tackling technical, UI and UX problems as I go.

Some of my code ends up on [my GitHub page](https://www.github.com/boyvanamstel) or the one I keep at [Danger Cove](https://www.github.com/dangercove).

I also like to reflect on how people interact with technical innovations, by creating websites like [Please Rob Me](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8521598.stm) and [ePenis](http://www.epenis.nl).

The best way to contact me is through [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/boyvanamstel).
