Most of my days are spent working on apps for the company that I founded in 2011, called [Danger Cove](http://www.dangercove.com). Porthole for example, is a Mac app that allows you to stream audio to multiple AirPlay speakers.

Iâ€™m particularly interested in working with new technology and making it accessible to as many people as I can.

Tackling technical, UI and UX problems as I go.

Some of my code ends up on [my GitHub page](https://www.github.com/boyvanamstel) or the one I keep at [Danger Cove](https://www.github.com/dangercove).

I also like to reflect on how people interact with technical innovations, by creating websites like [Please Rob Me](http://www.pleaserobme.com) and [ePenis](http://www.epenis.nl).

The best way to contact me is through [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/boyvanamstel), or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/boyvanamstel/) where I mostly share pictures of gadgets and exposed PCBs. ðŸ‘Œ
