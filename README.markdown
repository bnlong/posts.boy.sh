# tech.boy.sh

This is [where I write about tech stuff](https://tech.boy.sh). It uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the default theme.

I try to keep this site straightforward and easy to maintain.

## Development

Here's how to get the project up and running.

### Installing dependencies

The only requirements are listed in the `Gemfile`.

```bash
$ bundle install
```

### Running the project

```bash
$ bundle exec rake serve
```
